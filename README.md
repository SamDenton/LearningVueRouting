# LearningVueRouting
A quick demo site to learn Vue and Vue Router
To play around with and show off Vues dynamic updating I have build a site with a few cool tricks.
One 1 page, a live graphs shows the number of clicks the site has received in the last minute or 2, anywhere on the site.
The last page is an interactive physics simulation where different website elements and be spawned in and thrown around the screen, with some simple collision detection and physics logic.
